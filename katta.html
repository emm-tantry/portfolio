        <div class="problem">
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>There is redundancy with nonclickable elements. larger concepts aren't let to more detailed explanations of what they mean or where to learn more and it causes limitations on how effectively information in communicated to patients.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="goal">
          <h2>Goal</h2>
          <p>The main goal of the website is to educate and to lead patients to relevant articles and blog posts related to dermatology and good skincare and health habits. A sub-goal is to foster greater physician-patient trust.</p>

          <h2>Breakdown of Changes</h2>
          <h3><em>Navigation Bar</em></h3>
          <p>The previous navigation bar was quite large and redirected the user's attention, making navigating through the website more difficult. I condensed it down, meanwhile keeping its aesthetic integrity, and also moved some of the information to the cover section of the content.</p>
          <h3><em>Section 1 & 2</em></h3>
          <p>The first section was a header to the clickable links below. However, it was not intuitive for users to know this as they were visually disconnected. To assuage this issue, I moved the header besides the buttons to create a natural link between the two.</p>
          <h3><em>About the Doctor</em></h3>
          <p>To address the goal of increasing physician-patient trust, I rearranged the 'About the Doctor' section in a way where they are able to see her image while they begin reading about her. It allows them to attach an actual image to the description, making the experience feel more personal.</p>

      <div class="finalThoughts">
        <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
        <p>Working on this project was a very eye-opening experience. Accessibility was a very big aspect that I had to continually remind myself of as I started creating drafts, as the target audience of the website is for an older audience. Overall, user feedback was positive, as the stripped down version of the website, only including necessary elements, allowed patients to find the information and articles that they needed with more ease.</p>
